Hello everyone!
My name is Mansi. 
I am an undergraduate student at Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India. :mortar_board:  
Check out my [github](https://github.com/MansiBreja) profile.

I've worked on a few website projects during the last 2 years but I'm a newbie in openSource. 
I am very excited to contribute to open source!
Thank you for your time! :v:
